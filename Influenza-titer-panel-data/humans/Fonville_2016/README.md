## Fonville et al. 2016

This is the full supplementary information from [Fonville et al. 2016](https://academic-oup-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/jid/article/213/1/31/2459222#supplementary-data), which constructed antigenic maps from human sera sampled after primary infection in 9-24 month-olds, and using sera from ferrets.

Tab S2 contains the full human titer panel data.
Tab S1 contains some details about how human sera were selected from blood bank samples.
Tab S4 and S6 contain subsets of dataset S2.

Notes on dataset S2:

* Rows are test strains, and columns are individuals (sera).
* In the individual codes, the two-digit number (e.g. 95 in S95-1) represents the year of sample collection (1995). 
* Because all individuals were 9-24 months old at the time of sampling, the year of birth is 0-2 years before the  date of sampling.
