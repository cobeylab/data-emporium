* These are [Fluscape](http://www.iddynamics.jhsph.edu/projects/fluscape) data.
* I believe these are the same data analyzed in several other studies, including [Lessler et al. 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1432), [Kucharski et al. 2015](√), [Truelove et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/irv.12408), [Kucharski et al. 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004974), [Yang et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008635) and possibly others.
* This is a cross-sectional study.
* Some participatns have a history of vaccination.

Quoting from the [Lessler et al. 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1002802) methods:

> **Participant recruitment**
> Participants were enrolled from 100 randomly selected households from five study locations (20 per location) in a transect extending to the northeast from Guangzhou, China, as described in Lessler et al [[21]](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1432). All household members over two years of age were eligible to participate. Household members agreeing to participate were administered informed consent and offered two levels of participation: (1) completing a questionnaire and (2) completing the questionnaire and providing a blood sample. *Enrollment ran from July 8, 2009 to September 21, 2009.*

> **Strain selection**
> Nine strains of influenza A (H3N2) spanning the history of the virus from its emergence in 1968 until the present were selected for serological testing (Figure S7). We chose six vaccine strains from every second antigenic cluster, starting with a Hong Kong 1968 [10]: A/Hong Kong/1/1968 (H3N2), A/Victoria/3/1975 (H3N2), A/Bangkok/1/1979 (H3N2), A/Beijing/353/1989 (H3N2), A/Wuhan/359/1995 (H3N2) and A/Fujian/411/2002 (H3N2). In addition, three recently circulating H3N2 viruses isolated in southern China were selected for testing: A/Shantou/90/2003, A/Shantou/806/2005 and A/Shantou/904/2008. Shantou strains are genetically similar to contemporaneous vaccine strains, and may be presumed to be in same antigenic cluster as these viruses (see Figure S7).

> **Serological assays**
> Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and virus neutralization (NT) assays were performed for each of the nine selected strains of influenza A (H3N2) as described in Lessler et al. [21] Antibody titers were determined by testing serial two-fold dilutions from 1∶10 to 1∶1280 in duplicate (uncertain results were resolved by repeated testing in quadruplicate). Positive and negative control sera were also tested. The highest dilution resulting in complete protection of the cell monolayer in more than two of the quadruplicate wells (or both duplicate wells) was regarded as the antibody titer.
