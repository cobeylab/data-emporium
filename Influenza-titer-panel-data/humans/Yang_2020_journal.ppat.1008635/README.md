* The raw data are saved as .RData and .rds files in this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/UF-IDD/Fluscape_Paired_Serology).
* The script `parse_Yang_data.R` opens and explores the data files. It saves a copy of the full dataset to `Yang_paired.csv` and `Yang_seroconversion.csv`.

Quoting from the methods of [Yang et al. 2020](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008635):

> Both baseline (December 4, 2009 to January 22, 2011, with 44% of serum collected after the 2010 summer season started) and follow-up (June 17, 2014 to June 2, 2015, with 94% of serum collected after the 2014 summer season started) sera were available from 777 participants aged from 2 to 86 years old (age at baseline is used throughout unless otherwise noted) [18–20]. Participants giving serum were largely representative of the censused and overall study populations, with under representation of young children and over representation of participants aged 40–59 years (S1 Table) [18]. There were 10 participants (1.3%) who reported being vaccinated against influenza at baseline, and 5 participants (0.6%) who reported influenza vaccination between the two visits.
