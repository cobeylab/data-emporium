## Fonville et al. 2014, Science

* `Fonville_2014_supplement.xls` contains the raw supplementary data. 

* `Fonville_human_data.csv` is a copy of table S3, which contains the human data from the Ha Nam study.

* `YOB_inferred.csv` and `Fonville2014_FigS43.csv` are covariate data compiled manually by Kangchon Kim from supplementary figures. These can be merged with the main data file to aid analyses.

* Table S1 - "Sera from 35 influenza-na ̈ıve ferrets each infected with a single influenza A/H3N2 virus (viruses isolated between1989 and 2010) were collected 13-20 (typically 14) days post-infection. These sera were tested with the hemaggluti-nation inhibition (HI) assay against 74 A/H3N2 influenza viruses isolated globally between 1992 and 2011; the fulltitration table is given in Table S1 (see additional excel files)."
* Table S3 - Titers from participants in the HaNam Cohort study

    * 36 participants are from 6 highly compliant households in the study, and their sera are titrated against 38 viruses (isolated between 1993-2011).
    * 40 participants were selected at random and their sera were titrated against a more extensive set of 40 viruses (viruses isolated between 1968 and 2011).

* Table S5 - Titers from sera of 106 volunteers pre- and post-vaccination with A/Nanchang/933/95 (vaccination study performed in 1997). 
* Table S6 - Titers from sera of 128 volunteers pre- and post-vaccination with A/Sydney/5/97 (vaccination study performed in 1998).
* Table S9 - Strain coordinates for antigenic map underlying antibody landscapes (estimated from ferret sera).
* Table S13- 2009 vaccine serology panel (human -- I'm unclear if this is from the HaNam cohort).
* Table S14 - 2010 vaccine serology panel (human -- I'm unclear if this is from the HaNam cohort).
